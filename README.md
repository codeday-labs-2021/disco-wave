Disco Wave is making discos just a little bit cooler! With awesome audio visualizations and song suggestions from guests, your next party is going to be even cooler! 

## Description
Disco Wave is a website that a DJ can use with Spotify. Once a DJ has logged into Spotify, the Spotify API will find the song that is currently playing and will be displayed using an audio visualizer. This audio visualizer can be toggled between two types, allowing the DJ to choose the best one. A QR code will be on the screen, and other people can scan it to suggest songs they want to be played.
